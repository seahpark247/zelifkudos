# Zelif Kudos

I genuinely love our team I work with, a.k.a my Zelifgangs.

Every day, I see my colleagues putting in real effort, helping each other out, going the extra mile, and making work a better place to be. I wanted a simple way to say "hey, I noticed, and I appreciate you." That's why I built this app.

Whenever someone lends you a hand, brightens your day, or does something worth celebrating, send them a kudo. It takes five seconds, but it can make someone's whole day.

Here's to a team that lifts each other up. Let's keep it going.

with love,
Seah

## Overview

A peer recognition app I built solo for my team. From idea to production — designed, coded, and deployed by me, running live with real users.

Every week, teammates send each other kudos. On Friday evening, everyone gets a personalized email with the week's top stars and messages they received. Then the counter resets and a new week starts.

## Why I Built It

Verbal praise gets forgotten. Slack messages disappear. I wanted a simple way to say "I noticed you, and I appreciate you" — something that sticks around and actually feels good to use.

Nothing out there did what I wanted, so I made it myself.

## How It Works

**Login** — No passwords. You enter your company email, get a magic link, click it, you're in. The link expires in 15 minutes. Only `@zelifcam.net` emails are allowed, so authentication and access control happen in one step.

**Kudos** — Pick a teammate, write an optional message, send. There's a daily limit (5 per person) and a cooldown (10 min) to keep things genuine.

**Chat** — Real-time team chat via WebSocket. Messages are rate-limited (3-second cooldown, duplicate blocking) to prevent spam.

**Weekly Email** — Every Friday at 6 PM, a Quartz job sends each person an HTML email with:
- Top 3 stars of the week (dense ranking — ties share the same spot)
- How many kudos you got and what people said
- A rotating self-esteem message

The system sends all emails first, then resets only if every email succeeds. If one fails, nothing resets — no one gets skipped.

**Weekly Reset** — Every reset is logged with who triggered it (the system on Fridays, or an admin manually). Full audit trail.

## Tech Stack

Grails 6 (Groovy) on Spring Boot 2, PostgreSQL 16, WebSocket (SockJS + STOMP) for real-time chat, Quartz for scheduled jobs, Liquibase for DB migrations, Spring Session JDBC so sessions survive deploys.

Deployed on an Oracle Cloud Always Free VM via Docker. Total hosting cost: **$0/month**.

The UI is a Windows 98 retro theme — 800+ lines of pure CSS. Draggable chat window, mobile-responsive. People used it because it was fun.

## What I Learned

- **Passwordless auth is underrated** — simpler than password hashing + reset flows, better UX, and more secure for a small team
- **Rate limiting belongs at the right layer** — HTTP limits can't catch WebSocket spam, service limits can't catch duplicate chat messages. Each defense has to sit where it can see the problem
- **Dense ranking has edge cases** — "top 3" means top 3 rank levels, not top 3 people. 5 people tied for 1st? That's 5 gold medals and no silver
- **Free-tier constraints force good decisions** — 256MB heap limit meant no waste. Spring Session JDBC solved "deploy kills all sessions" without needing Redis

## Running Locally

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # fill in your values
docker compose up -d   # start the database
./gradlew bootRun      # run the app
```

The app will be at `http://localhost:8080`.
